Summary: you can look up each roundâ€™s inflation percentage (inflationRate) and multiply inflationRate * totalSupplyAtSnapshot = totalRewards to get total rewards up for grabs.

ext, grab all voters who voted correctly via the winnerGroup and figure out their share of the total rewards: voter.numTokens / totalVoteAmount * 1e18 = voterShareOfRewards

Voter rewards is then voterShareOfRewards * totalRewards

Doable, but increases the complexity of completing this.
